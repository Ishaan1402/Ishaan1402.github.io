## Personal Portfolio Website


I took a weekend to develop a website of my own from scratch. The aim of this project was simply to be exposed to web development before learning it in any of my classes. I also want to use this website as a way for people to get to know me and see my projects. I referenced several guides to help me get started. I used VSCode for HTML, CSS, JS. I also used Github Pages for free hosting.
